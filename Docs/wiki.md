## Notes from GameManager
Getting Node because it has a scene, 
then the scene allows you to access the methods within the scenes nodes

//Newing this class, because its a CS script and theres no Node to be gotten

//Need to instansiate the GameManager, its set at singleton by AutoLoading (in Godot Editor ->
//Project Settings/Globals/Autoload add the Script that has the class you need to be instansiated
//Then the Global Variable Box doesnt to anything for C#, and we therefore must write the code below!
//Also remember to add it as an attribute up above
